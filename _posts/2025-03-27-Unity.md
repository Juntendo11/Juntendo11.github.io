After years of focusing on the artistic side of things with Blender, ZBrush, and Substance, I’ve finally decided to learn Unity.

At first, I was torn between Unreal with C++ and Unity with C#. Given my prior experience with C++, Unreal’s impressive rendering capabilities, and all the drama surrounding Unity, I was almost convinced to go with Unreal. But deep down, I had a gut feeling that Unity aligned more with my interests.

Reluctantly, Unity was engine of choice for my thesis project—and with that, my procrastination days are finally over. Unity provides a fun 3D playground for experimentation, whether it’s visualization, motion capture, shaders, or physics simulations.

I’m also finding C# to be a much more friendly scripting language than C++, thanks to its higher-level abstractions, excellent documentation, and the wealth of tutorials available.

I can’t wait to dive into VR development and keep learning!
