Much like FastAI for pytorch, Tensorflow provides native abstraction layer with keras, which simplify the task of creating convolutional neural network model.
With intuitive official documentation, AI detection model was created with minimalistic approach, which yielded close to 95% accuracy rate for detecting AI images.
Fantastic. 
Could I do better?

Yes...
-data augmentation
-epochs
-over-trained?
-What about bigger images?


To be continued...
