Personally, Im disappointed that I dont use the trackball as much as I hoped.

Tracking accuracy isn't the best and so fine movement 

Maybe more practice is what I need.


# Uni
Team project is progressing well, but much more to go

Zephyr configs can be pain and debugging configs aren't clear

# 3D
 3DSMax seems to be as good as its UI looks haha

Zbrush subscription ended before I finished and seriously considering switching to Blender.

I miss unity

When will my Quest 3 arrive??? Meta???
